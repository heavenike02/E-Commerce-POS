This code is for creating a point of sale system for a car dealership. The MainForm class is responsible for managing the main form of the application, including the user interface and functionality of the sidebar menu. The StartBlankDesign method hides all sub panels when the application starts, while the HideSubPanel method is used to hide any visible sub panels. The ShowSubMenu method is used to show a specific sub panel when its corresponding button in the sidebar menu is clicked. The OpenChildFord method is used to open and display child forms within the main application. There are also various event handlers for the buttons in the sidebar menu, which are used to open specific forms or perform specific actions when clicked. Overall, this code provides the framework for navigating and interacting with the point of sale system within the car dealership.
